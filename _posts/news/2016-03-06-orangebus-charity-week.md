When I started at [Orange Bus](http://www.orangebus.co.uk) last January my wife was already 3 months pregnant with twins, at the time and we already knew then that it was going to be a difficult pregnancy. Once our twins arrived last May I could not have asked for any more support and understanding then Orange Bus gave us.

Who is Orange Bus?
------------------
Orange Bus is a digital agency based in Newcastle and London. We make cool websites, apps, and generally help forward-thinking companies and organisations with their digital strategy.

------------
The Orange Bus team decided to support two charity partners for 2016. We are delighted that ours was chosen and The Brain Tumour Charity supported by Angela ([the brain tumour warrior](https://braintumourwarrior.wordpress.com/)) one of the Account Managers at Orange Bus. This coming week, March 7th to 11th, is #obcharity week, and we’re embarking upon all sorts of fun and wonderful activities to raise money for these two causes: the week kick starts with The Great OB Bake Off, followed by Agency League Footy, a sponsored ‘Walking with Grace’ wander and then culminating in the much loved OB Pub Quiz at the Cluny 2.

All of Orange Bus, especially myself and Angela, would love for you to support us! Here’s how you can:

Donating to and sharing our Crowdfunder page <http://orangeb.us/obcharity>

Following the fun and spreading the word using our hashtag #obcharity

If you’re based near Newcastle, taking part in Thursday’s sponsored walk! Call us on 0191 241 3703 or email <hello@orangebus.co.uk> to discuss arrangements.

Many thanks

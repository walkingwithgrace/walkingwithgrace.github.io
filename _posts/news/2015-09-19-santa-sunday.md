My gran had mentioned at `church that we were setting up a charity in Grace’s name. This is a church that is very close to all our hearts within the family as my gran and granddad were married there, my mum and dad were married there, my sister and I were both christened there and finally myself and Scott got married there in 2014. Another church go’ers brother along with friends at their local pub do what is known as Santa Sunday event (now twice a year) where they do a fundraising night for a local charity. We were lucky enough to be the selected charity for the Summer event. The patrons of the pub had an amazing event and raised an extraordinary amount of £1175. We were presented with the cheque by Billy Duffy and the Manager of the Fountains Inn plus staff.

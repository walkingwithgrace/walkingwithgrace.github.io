> Lotti and Scott have recently gone through an extremely difficult time that only people in the same situation can possibly understand. For them both to want to give something back to the Unit are remarkable. Providing these lovely gifts of “Miniboos” to each baby born too soon will not only help promote bonding between these very precious babies and their parents but will also be a reminder that there are some very special people in the world and that others do care. On behalf of the Parents and Staff of North Tees Neonatal Unit I would like to say a heartfelt Thank you.

> I feel that Cuski is a brilliant initiative to promote bonding when close, physical contact isn't always possible, they have also been positively used as a comfort to baby and in turn allows parents to offer their baby some comfort when they may not be able to be present. Cuski works as a link between skin to skin and helps mummies with stimulation for expressing. Cuski has an added advantage for twins as it can be interchanged between babies and mummy so that they each experience each other's scents.

After delivery Charlotte tied all the cards to the boxes of Cuski Mini-boos ready for delivery to the Unit.

On Monday September 15th, Charlotte, Scott and baby set off in a very loaded car to deliver the first 100 Cuski’s to the Neonatal Unit.

Debbie Byran, Ward Manager along with a number of the staff who had helped look after Grace and Bella were on hand to receive the Cuski’s.

All the staff who had seen Grace with her ‘boo’ agreed what a wonderful bonding and comforting aid the mini Cuski made.
Charlotte was thrilled to be able to present the very first Cuski Mini-boo to Baby Riley and his parents Jordan and Leon.

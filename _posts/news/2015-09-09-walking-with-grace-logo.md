When Charlotte and Scott set up the Charity they knew they needed a logo.  A friend of Scott’s at OrangeBus said she would design a logo for them. Emma came up with a number of designs but the very first one was not only similar to a photo Charlotte and Scott had had of the girls feet together but used the colour we all associated as Grace’s colour, hence the Walking With Grace foot logo in deep pink!

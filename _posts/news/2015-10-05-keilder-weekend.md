So the event of the year has arrived, set off at 10am to get up to Kielder in time to get the bike to the correct place and to the start line. And always time for a pre run photo

We only caught the start

So a 10k run, followed by a 26k bike (around Kielder Reservoir) followed by the final 6k run. I am not sure how Scott managed to complete the event, amazing is all I can say. He completed it in a very respectable time of 4hours 20minutes. Grace got him around the final 10k bike and then the 6k run. It was a very emotional day so much so we all cried as Scott crossed the finish line.

and the finish.

The day was not without worry and panic as Scott had thought it would take him between 3.5-4 hours and when 4 hours was approaching I asked one of the volunteers if they knew where Scott was and the answer was no. I eventually found Dickie who was running the event under Sir Steve Cram, he tracked Scott’s number and then eventually when he was finished he event took us all the way back to our car and gave us an amazing donation of £10 as he is a twin himself.

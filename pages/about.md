Grace's Story
=============

Grace and her twin sister, Bella where born 9 weeks premature at North Tees University Hospital after a complicated pregnancy. We had not expected Grace to survive long after birth but thanks to the amazing efforts of the Doctors and Nurses in the Neonatal Unit we got to meet and know Grace along with her sister over the next 6 weeks. Both Grace and Bella inspired staff and visitors with their amazing progress and infectious personalities. Grace touched so many hearts that it felt right to start this charity with the hope that in her memory she will continue to do so.

  text: Walking with Grace is a charity set up in remembrance of our daughter Grace
    who sadly past away on the 24th of June 2015 after 47 amazing days with us. The
    aim of our charity is to support families with babies requiring Intensive Care
    or High Dependancy Incubated Neonatal Care; initially for babies born at North
    Tees University Hospital with the gift of a <a href="http://www.cuski.co.uk/cuskiboo/index.php">Cuski
    Miniboo</a> like the pink one seen in Graces picture. The mini comforter aid in
    the bonding between parents and babies in incubators and are NHS approved.
